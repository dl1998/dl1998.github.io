            <p>
                A verb, from the Latin verbum meaning word, is a word (part of speech) that in syntax conveys an action
                (bring, read, walk, run, learn), an occurrence (happen, become), or a state of being (be, exist, stand).
                In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle to, is the infinitive.
                In many languages, verbs are inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood, and voice. A
                verb may also agree with the person, gender or number of some of its arguments, such as its subject, or
                object. Verbs have tenses: present, to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate
                that an action has been done; future, to indicate that an action will be done.

            <h3> Agreement </h3>
            <p>
                In languages where the verb is inflected, it often agrees with its primary argument (the subject) in
                person,
                number or gender. With the exception of the verb to be, English shows distinctive agreements only in the
                third person singular, present tense form of verbs, which are marked by adding "-s" ( walks) or "-es"
                (fishes). The rest of the persons are not distinguished in the verb (I walk, you walk, they walk, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                Latin and the Romance languages inflect verbs for tense–aspect–mood (abbreviated 'TAM'), and they agree
                in
                person and number (but not in gender, as for example in Polish) with the subject. Japanese, like many
                languages with SOV word order, inflects verbs for tense-aspect-mood, as well as other categories such as
                negation, but shows absolutely no agreement with the subject - it is a strictly dependent-marking
                language.
                On the other hand, Basque, Georgian, and some other languages, have polypersonal agreement: the verb
                agrees
                with the subject, the direct object, and even the secondary object if present, a greater degree of
                head-marking than is found in most European languages.
